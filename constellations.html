        Andromeda was the wife of the great hero Perseus, who had saved her from a sea monster.
        She had been chained to a rock by Posideon to punish her mother who insisted her and her daughter
        were more beautiful than Posiedeon's nymphs.
        Perseus was taken by Andromeda's beauty and agreed to save her as long as he could marry her.
        She was placed between her parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia, by the goddess Athena.
        This constellation appears primarily in late winter.

        Orion was a hunter who boasted that he would rid the world of all wild animals.
        The Earth Goddess, Gaia, sent a scorpion after him, impervious to mortal harm.
        Orion tried to flee, but Apollo soon spotted him and challenged Artemis to hit his distant figure.
        Upon his death, Artemis begged to gods to bring him back, but they refused.
        She then placed him among the stars.
        The mighty hunter is easily identified by the three in-line stars that make up his belt.

        Scorpius (or Scorpio), the scorpion, is one of the tweleve symbols of the Zodiac.
        Scorpius was sent by Gaia to kill Orion the hunter after learning of his dangerous boast.
        The Scorpion was unsuccessful as Orion slipped away, so would continue it's chase in the heavens.
        However it would never succeed as Scorpius was placed on the opposite side of the sky, so it would only rise after
        Orion had safely set.

        Ursa Major is the third largest constellation, with one of the most identifiable asterisms - the Big Dipper.
        The Big Dipper is not an official constellation, but rather a small part of the larger Ursa Major.
        In Greek mythology, Callisto was one of Artemis's companions who was seduced by Zeus.
        Artemis, angry that Callisto had broken her vows, turned her into a bear to hunt down.
        Zeus took pity on the girl and had her placed in the heavens instead.

        Draco the dragon constellation wraps itself around the North Pole and is hard to spot.
        Draco comes from the story of Hercules, wherein the hero was tasked with stealing golden apples from
        Hera. The tree they grew on was protected by the dragon Ladon, who Hercules slew so that Atlas could take
        the apples on his behalf. Hera was heartbroken after her dragon's death, and had him placed in the heavens.

        Gemini, the twins constellation, is one of the tweleve symbols of the Zodiac.
        The Twins consist of two half-brothers, Pollux and Castor. The two shared a mother, Leda, but different fathers.
        Pollux was the immortal son of Zeus, while Castor was the mortal son of Tyndareus.
        When Castor died, Pollux mourned the loss of his brother and Zeus was so touched by Pollux's love of
        his brother that he had them placed side by side in the heavens.
